Idea/PoC Title:
Prediction of Major Crop Yield Using Artificial Neural Networks
Abstract of Idea/PoC: 
One of the most important tasks involved in the agricultural planning intention is the accurate yield estimation for the numerous crops
in order to make accurate plans for food security in nation.[3] Some common prediction methods are – Statistical, Crop Simulation and
Machine Learning. Out of these, the Statistical and Crop Simulation models are common. However, these methods do not yield as accurate 
results as with modern Machine Learning Algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).  These ML techniques use large data sets 
related to crop yield to train the predictive model and the model can self-improvise its predictive capabilities and accuracy.


Sector of Focus (Theme): Agriculture and Food
Detail about Idea/PoC:

1.	Define Problem Statements (or) Pain Points:
As per 2018, Agriculture sector employed 50% of the Indian work force and contributed about 17-18% to country's GDP.
[1] The population of India will be 1.4 billion by 2020 and will need ~ 109 MT of wheat to meet the changing kitchen and other needs.
[2] This makes agriculture sector planning a matter of great importance at this time to ensure food security of the nation. 
For planning policies, important statistics are needed beforehand such as yield prediction of major crops. The current crop simulation and statistical methods of prediction like are not quite accurate and we need more accurate methods for prediction.

2.	Prescribe solution to the defined problem:
To predict the crop yield accurately we will use a predictive Machine Learning model based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
For this we will need large datasets of factors related to crop yield (weather and non-weather factors) as well as actual crop 
yield for many years to train the model for prediction. The data is easily accessible on the web-portals of related department
portals (such as Meteorological Department, Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Department of Fertilizers, etc.) and can
be downloaded with high assurance of accuracy. The model will provide an accurate prediction of the crop yield and will help
in advanced planning needs of the Government. 

3.	What is the technological innovation associate with the solution:
An Artificial neural Network (ANN), which is also called a multilayer perceptron, works as information processed by the human brain
(Hinton, 1992). Due to its ability to learn from experience in order to improve their performance it is a powerful technique for
accurate predictions. It is an innovative technology to help improve our precision farming methodology and more accurate than old 
Statistical and Crop Simulation methods.

4.	Define if any Intellectual property (IP) component associate with the solution prescribed (for category A) or Define the social benefits associate with the solutions prescribed (for Category B). (Specify with in 50 words)
There are multiple social benefits directly associated with accurate crop yield prediction –
[i] a forecast of crop yield prediction will help farmers in risk management.
[ii] government can make use of the statistics provided in forming crop insurance policies and policies for supply chain operations.
[iii] government institutes like FCI can procure essential food-grains in advance by importing, if needed to ensure national food
security.
5.	How the prescribed solution is more relevant and suitable for adoption to current market requirement (Specify with in 100 words)
The current methodology used is less precise as well as resource intensive. However, once an Artificial Neural Network Model is
trained it is fairly fast and more accurate than other methods. It is a step in modernizing the prevalent techniques among
scholars and statistical organizations in India and to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and Deep Learning.
Hence, it’s less resource intensive nature, capability to provide quick results and accurate predictions as compared to other methods 
currently in use make it more and more relevant and suitable for adoption to current market requirements. 

Is Prototype Ready? YES/NO
	Yes, the prototype is ready and live at:
https://github.com/toughyear/Artificial-Neural-Networks-Application/
However, it is in very early phase and needs more data input as well as fine tuning in its algorithm (using back propagation).
A user will need a data science software platform RapidMiner© Studio to view the project.
